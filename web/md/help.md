## How to Use SaoLa

### Searching

Type any Vietnamese or English word in the search box.

If you type a Vietnamese word with a tone mark, Saola will try to find an exact match, although entering words without tone marks is also fine (e.g., “the gioi” finds “thế giới”).

Typing ambiguous words like “the” and “may” will bring up results in both languages. You can collapse the section headings so that it is easier to find the section you are looking for.

### Pronunciation guides

To help you master one or both of the major varieties of Vietnamese, SaoLa includes phonetic respellings and IPA. The respellings require a basic grasp of the spelling-to-sound correspondence in Northern Vietnamese. They illustrate the pronunciation using only the letters in the Vietnamese alphabet (plus w, y, and z) and, for the most part, their Northern pronunciation.

They are based on the information in [this blog post](https://nguyentienhai.blogspot.com/2016/12/giong-mien-nao-gan-voi-giong-chuan-quoc.html) (in Vietnamese), though SaoLa’s respellings are further adapted for learners. This sometimes results in some unconventional letter combinations. Some subtleties were omitted to keep the respellings easy-to-read. In the following notes, `this` means Vietnamese spelling, @/this/@ means IPA, and *this* means phonetic respelling.

- *x*, *s*, *tr*, *ch* denote their Southern pronunciation; in the North only the sounds corresponding to *x* @/s/@ and *tr* @/t͡ɕ/@ are used
- The long vowel `a` is often somewhere between @/a~æ/@ in the South; `ǎ` remains the same pure short vowel
- Other Southern long vowels `iê`-`uô`-`ươ` are denoted by the nonstandard spellings *ii, uu, ưư*
- `oc`-`ôc`-`uc` and `ong`-`ông`-`ung` are written as *aocp*, *âungm*, etc. (This does **not** apply to `uôc`-`uông`.) This is necessary to distinguish the Southern pronunciation of the finals in groups like these:
  - lon, lòng = *loong, làongm*
  - bún, bụng = *búng, bụngm*
  - lúc/lụt, luộc = *lúcp, luục*
  - luận, luôn = *lụng, luung*
  - cuốn, cũng = *cuúng, cũngm*
  - thuộc, thuật, thúc = *thuục, thục, thúcp*
  - chuẩn, chuồn, chuông, chùm, chung = *chủng, chuùng, chuung, chùm, chungm*
  - xuân, xuống, súng = *xung, xuúng, súngm*
